# Go-Apps

This repository contains golang methods and functions used to learn and test knowledge on building apis and web services.

So far using this repo, I learned about middleware, routing, configuration, rendering and handling of service in golang.

Used go mods to configure the versioning of dependencies and used go templates to handle html and passing data to the web application.
